# Custom Problem

The library also allows for the analysis of problems that can not be solved with `DifferentialEquations` as an backend such as Multi-Agent Simulations or models that need to run other external code. These kind of problems can be analyzed with the help of [`CustomMCBBProblem`](@ref). It is programmed to mirror the behaviour of `DifferentialEquations`. A longer how-to will follow, but for now a look in the references can help you for the start.

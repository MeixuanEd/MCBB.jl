The libary also allows for the analysis of problems that can not be solved with `DifferentialEquations` as an backend such as Multi-Agent Simulations or models that need to run other external code. These kind of problems can be analyzed with the help with [`CustomMCBBProblem`](@ref). A longer how-to will follow, but for now a look in the references can help you for the start.

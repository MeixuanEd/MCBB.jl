# Continuation

The libary also includes some tools to run a more classical bifurcation analysis by continuing the integration of a system with a changed parameter and the end point of the last integration as the new initial conditions. A detailed how-to will follow, but for now there's also already a reference ([`ContinuationProblem`](@ref))
